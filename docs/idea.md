Current programming languages are designed with a human programmer in mind, but we're seeing a shift towards programming being driven more and more by AI coding agents. Design a new programming language that optimizes for context and token management while providing modern programming concepts and language features. The language should prioritize LLM tokenization and context management over human readability while also providing mechanisms for expanding the implementations into easier to read formats, we'll call these modes compact vs relaxed. Since we're organizing this around LLM agentic programming, we should retain the prompts in the code / revision history in some way to assist in auditing how code has evolved over time. Naturally this needs metadata such as LLM version, agent version, etc to support and potentially security features to ensure the fidelity and integrity of the codes lifetime. This metadata could be shadowed with the files themselves, or included as comments within the code. I hypothesize we'd benefit most from enforcing small composable code, which isn't typically enforced in languages. However we have a lot of freedom to consider novel file hierarchies that could lend themselves to this new paradigm, where previously an organic tree structure tends to develop. Let's call this language Zero1.
